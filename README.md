## Who am I 😉
- Hello! I'm Lee Hyunje, a non-stop developer.
- I like to learn new things. I try not to stop gaining new knowledge.
- I feel the greatest joy when I make code of what I think.
- It seeks sustainable development, not a one-off project.
- I think developers are not just code makers as they are given, but they are '**value creators**' who actively create things that can help people.
